<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Srujan</h1>

<h3 align="left">ðŸš€ About Me:</h3>

<p>I am an aspiring Data Analyst who is pursuing a Master's in Data Analytics and Management from the Illinois Institute of Technology Chicago, complementing my Bachelor's in Electronics and Instrumentation.</p>
  
<p>I love applying data-driven insights to difficult problems and bringing about significant change. I possess a strong foundation in SQL,Â machine learning, statistics, and programming languages such as R and Python. I have developed my skills in data preprocessing, modeling, and visualization during my academic career by working with a variety of datasets.</p>
  
<p>Working in collaborative settings where I can work with interdisciplinary teams to develop data-driven solutions is something I really appreciate. I'm eager to look at chances where I can use my abilities and support creative, data-driven solutions.</p>
 
Please feel free to reach out to me via email or on LinkedIn.

<p>Currently, I'm working on a goal to create an interactive website that provides data about Fruits upon image upload to help people to keep track on what they consume and its pros and cons. Utilizing Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, OpenCV, NumPy, Python, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for image classification.Impementing UI using Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jupyter, VS Code, and PyCharm. Planning on building an app further on to capture images of fruits and get to know about them to bring mobility to users. 
 
Performed customer segmentation to increase revenue for a UK-based online gift store. Conducted 5 unsupervised clustering tasks to identify the best model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, micro-precision, micro-recall, micro-F1, and micro-AUC. Utilized K-means, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture model, Hierarchical. Determined and visualized 3 distinct customer segments with 8 characteristics. 
In addition, I've worked on  various projects including Developing a pollution level forecasting model using air quality attributes, with a focus on the Beijing PM2.5 dataset. The goal was to create precise and timely PM2.5 concentration predictions for actionable insights. 
Data preprocessing: Explored the dataset, checked for missing values and duplicate rows, calculated dataset correlations, and used an 80% hold-out validation for training. 
Regression: Utilized various regression methods, including the full model, backward elimination using p-value in t-test and AIC, forward selection using AIC, and stepwise selection using AIC. 
Data postprocessing: Addressed multicollinearity issues, removed influential points, and evaluated the model using n-crossfold validation. You can explore all my projects in the [Projects](https://github.com/SrujanSShetty/Data-Analytics) repository. </p>
